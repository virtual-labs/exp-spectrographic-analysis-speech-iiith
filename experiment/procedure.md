- Step5: Verify that transitions between adjacent sound units from the formant contours observed from the spectrogram.

- Step6: Identify/locate voiced/unvoiced/plosive/silence regions from the spectrogram.

- Step7: Observe the time varying excitation and system characteristics from the spectrogram.

- Step8: Write a brief note on the observations.
