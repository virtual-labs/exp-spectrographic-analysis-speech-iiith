### Assignment

1. What should be the number of NFFT points relative to derive narrow and wideband spectrograms?

2. Explain how one can measure the fundamental frequency and fundamental period from the spectrogram.

3. Why cannot fundamental period be estimated from wideband spectrogram.

4. Explain the spectrogram characteristics of the fricative /s/.

5. Record the VCV utterances /ata/ and /ada/. What can you say about the spectrographic characteristics.
